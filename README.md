# Plebs Dept.

Plebs Dept. is play on the name of a company I formerly worked for (luxury fashion shopping club PS Dept.). We used to joke about needing an app to find the less expensive, 'plebeian' version of some of the clothing we sold. One day I built this.

Plebs Dept. is a tiny Clojure API that currently only does one thing: returns up to 30 trendy fashion products from one of five randomly selected current trends. The products are pulled from the ShopStyle API. It's millennial pink because it's funny, and the grid is Masonry because it looks nice and I'm not too good at design. Hosted on Heroku.

The repo for the front end is [here](https://github.com/alexshook/plebs_dept), and you can view it in action [here](http://alexshook.com/plebs_dept/).
